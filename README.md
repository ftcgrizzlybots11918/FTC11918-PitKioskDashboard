# Grizzly Bots Pit Dashboard
### This is a part of an idea we had for our pit. 
#### 

We don't use any frameworks here, so you can just download this repo, open the ```index.html```, and get started in the dashboard. Or, just open it [here.](https://ftcgrizzlybots11918.github.io/FTC11918-PitKioskDashboard) 

If you have an idea for a contribution, create an issue, and if you feel ready, go ahead and make a pull request and implement it yourself!
